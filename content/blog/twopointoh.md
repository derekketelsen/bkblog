A week ago I left my job at [backplane](http://backplane.io).  I think backplane is an amazing service that will be very successful.  I think Blake and his team are amazing people to work for and with.  I didn't leave because of them.

## Flashback: GopherCon 2016
I taught a one day workshop at GopherCon - Building HTTP APIs in Go - and I really enjoyed the experience.  Putting together the class was a lot of fun, and I got a lot of very positive feedback from the people in the class.  I've done corporate training in the past and I had forgotten how much fun it is.  As the feedback from the class started coming in, it occured to me that this might be the solution to a problem I've had for three years now.

## The Conference Organizer's Dilemma
Running a technical conference takes a tremendous toll on a person.  It's at least a full-time job for the several months leading up to the conference.  But for all three years I've been co-organizing GopherCon with Erik St. Martin I've had a full time job to pay the bills.  We run GopherCon lean so the cost to attend is as low as possible -- that means it's never going to be something I can use to replace the income of a "day job".  We've talked about it several times, and we're not interested in raising the prices to turn GopherCon into a profit-making enterprise.  GopherCon is about the community, and even though attending a conference is never cheap we don't want to make the ticket price any higher than it has to be to pay the bills.  The challenge for both of us has been to juggle full time jobs while organizing a conference and still having families that need our time and attention too.

## The Solution
It didn't take me long to realize that I can't continue at this burnout rate. I love the Go community, and helping to foster its growth is one of the places in my life where I get the most satisfaction.  The logical conclusion for me is to adjust my career to match the things in my life that are important.  So today I'm announcing Brian Ketelsen 2.0.  I've aligned my work life with the needs of my family, my abilities, and my passion for the Go community.  I have a four pronged plan for paying the bills.

### Consulting
I'm available for short term and project based [consulting](https://brianketelsen.com/consulting/).  Get in touch if you need some help with a stubbor project or just want to do some staff augmentation.  Details are in the "Consulting" link in the menu above.

### Online Training
I've started an [online learning center](http://learn.brianketelsen.com) where my first course is available to purchase.  It's a deep dive into the amazing `goa` code generation framework for building APIs in Go.  The course isn't complete yet, but if you [buy it now](http://learn.brianketelsen.com/courses/master-api-development-with-goa?product_id=140234&coupon_code=GOAVIDEO) you'll get a great discounted rate and you can follow along as new lessons are released.  The `goa` class is the first of many.  Some will be free, but most will be inexpensive like this first one.  If you have ideas for topics you want me to cover, I'd love your feedback.  I plan to cover topics including:

* Microservices
* Distributed Applications / Coordination (Go focused)
* Testing (Go focused)
* Containers and Orchestration (Kubernetes, Rancher, Docker)

I hope that these courses fill a gap in the learning materials available today.  Most of the learning materials available aren't very specific and don't dive deep enough into a topic to be of much immediate value.  These courses won't be generalized, but specific and detailed classes that you can put to use right away.

### In Person Training
I've also partnered with [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com) to offer in-person training classes in Boston and San Francisco.  You'll see more specific details with dates and registration information as soon as we've ironed out the schedules.  

### Corporate Training
Finally, I'm booking corporate training classes for teams that want to learn about Go, Distributed Computing, and Orchestration technologies.  I've got several companies lined up already and I'm very excited to share my [experience](/about/experience).  If your team is looking to level-up on Go, Docker, or Kubernetes shoot me an [email](me@brianketelsen.com) and get on the schedule!
