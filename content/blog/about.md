Howdy! You've stumbled here because you're bored with Hacker News.  I understand.  On this site you're likely to find things about Go, building communities, and maybe the occasional post about my hobbies: drones, 3d printing, target shooting, and travel and camping.

I co-organize GopherCon, a community-focused conference for Go programmers held annualy in Denver, Colorado.  GopherCon's parent company is GopherAcademy which I founded with Erik St. Martin in the hopes of planting the seeds early in Go's growth curve for an open, inclusive, and friendly programming community.  

To pay the bills I do training and consulting on Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.  More information [here](https://www.gopheracademy.com).

I love devops, containers, orchestration, Go, microservices, messaging, monitoring, and generally connecting things together that weren't previously connected.  You might know of me from my creation [skydns](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns), which provides DNS service discovery for most of the Kubernetes installations on the Internet, or from [Go In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/go-in-action) which I co-wrote with Bill Kennedy and Erik St. Martin. Long ago I created RailsLiveCD which was a linux distribution I built before awesome tools like RVM existed to make installing Ruby and Rails easier.

I'm currently playing around with Nim and Elixir to keep my skills sharp.

Previously, I was the CIO at [XOR Data Exchange](https://xor.exchange) and [Clarity Services](https://www.clarityservices.com).

You can hear me talk about Go weekly on the [GoTime podcast](http://gotime.fm).  We stream live at 3PM Eastern time most Thursdays, and our episodes appear in the usual places after some light editing by the Changelog team.
